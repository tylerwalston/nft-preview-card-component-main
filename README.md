## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Reinforcing my understanding of CSS positioning, especially 'responsive-first.' Also, using unordered lists within articles was much easier than having to style extra divs for the for the price and time icon/text components.   

### Continued development

I need a few more of these under my belt, and to dive deeper into understanding media queries.
